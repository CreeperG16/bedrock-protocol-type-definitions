# bedrock-protocol-type-definitions

Type definitions for packets in [bedrock-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/bedrock-protocol)
I made this in what little free time I had, it isn't practical, all written manually, definitely will contain errors, and nowhere near done. But it's been sitting on my file server for a while and it's useful, if not yet for completely type-safe programming with bedrock-protocol, but for the IDE's autocomplete at least. I will probably try to keep updating this, and later on I might figure out how to generate it automatically.

I wrote all of these from the protocol YML and JSON files in [minecraft-data](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data), usually by copying the packet's format and changing it to typescript.
